For exercises 2.1-2.5 I have used my own course information exercises.

For exercise dataforcountries to work, please give a https://openweathermap.org/ API key as environment variable when starting the application. The name of env variable is REACT_APP_API_KEY.

All 20 exercises for part 2, including the ones marked with a *, were completed.

For the CSS needed to show alerts in the phonebook I used the one as used in the accompanying example text as displayed in the example image of the exercise.
